# Shreya's Developer Portfolio

Welcome. This is my personal developer portfolio built with React and customized on top of the DeveloperFolio template. It showcases who I am, what I build, and how to reach me.

The design uses smooth animations, and a clean layout focused on readability.

- Styling: SCSS modules with a global color system
